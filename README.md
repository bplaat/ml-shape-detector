# Machine Learning Shape Detector
A implementation of a neural network that can detect shapes

## Different folders / versions explained
- `javascript-matrix/` contains the JavaScript implementation of the matrix based neural network system, it also contains the `painter.html` website with which you can draw your own shapes
- `native-matrix/` contains the C implementtation of the matrix based neural network
- `python-matrix/` contains the Python implementation of the matrix based neural network this is also the only version with a steepest decent training algorithm
- `python-node/` contains the Python node based neural network which was the base objective for this school project
